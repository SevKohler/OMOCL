# OMOCL

Note
------
OMOCL is the result of a research project. To support our research, please cite one of our papers instead of referencing our github in scientific articles. You can find an overview of papers about OMOCL here. If you are not sure which paper to cite, we recommend this one:

Severin Kohler, Diego Boscá, Florian Kärcher, Birger Haarbrandt, Manuel Prinz, Michael Marschollek, Roland Eils, Eos and OMOCL: Towards a seamless integration of openEHR records into the OMOP Common Data Model, Journal of Biomedical Informatics, Volume 144, 2023 [(Link)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2023.104437)

Thanks!

Introduction
------

The OMOP Conversion Language is a declerative mappings language for openEHR archetype-to-CDM mappings. It is based on yaml.
For more info check our [wiki](https://github.com/SevKohler/OMOCL/wiki). 

For a engine to execute the mappings see [Eos](https://github.com/SevKohler/Eos)

#### mapping coverage 

85.93%
█████████▒
*counting published archetypes from the international ckm*

The missing archetypes are not transformable into OMOP in a useful way, please check the documentation/ for more information. 
Status 18.02.2025

For the caluculation and overview of what is mapped see:

This script can be also used to get an overview how much of your local CKM is already mapped to OMOP, or the archetypes used.
