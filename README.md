Introduction
------

The OMOP Conversion Language is a declerative mappings language for openEHR archetype-to-CDM mappings. It is based on yaml.
For more info check our [wiki](https://github.com/SevKohler/OMOCL/wiki). 

For a engine to execute the mappings see [Eos](https://github.com/SevKohler/Eos)
